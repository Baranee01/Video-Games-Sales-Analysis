When the sales of video games is more than 10 million in a year then the year is said to be, a successful gaming year. To check whether a year has been successful or not, an extra column named target sales has been added with all values as 10.

In the above KPI scorecards, we have compared the sales of North America , Europe, Japan, Other region with the target sales individually. Here North America and Europe sales are more than the target sales whereas the Japan sales and other region sales are less than the target sales.
